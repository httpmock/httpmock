This section explains how to configure the mock server to generate **dynamic responses**.  
Custom responders give you full control over the returned status, headers, and body at runtime.

<Aside type="caution" title="Attention">
    Custom responders are **not available** when connecting to standalone mock servers (e.g., by using one of the
    `connect` methods, such as
    [`MockServer::connect`](https://docs.rs/httpmock/0.7.0/httpmock/struct.MockServer.html#method.connect)).
